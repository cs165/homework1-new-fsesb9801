			6 Reasons Why You Should Create Listicles

			Listicles have become increasingly popular with content marketers. While old-school journalists may scoff at the format, there’s no denying the results – more clicks, more engagement and more shares.
		</p>
		<p>
			While listicles have been around for a long time, a few viral-content websites have greatly contributed to their rising use (we’re looking at you, Buzzfeed). If you’re trying to figure out if listicles are right for your content mix, I’ve put together some of the most compelling reasons. Not surprisingly, they’re organized into… a list.
		</p>
		<div class="list_title">1. Headlines with numbers attract attention</div>
		<p>
			Readers love numbers. When skimming through a sea of text, numbers stand out. They help the brain organize information and also set expectations about how much information you’re about to receive. Nobody knows exactly why, but odd numbers are considered more attractive and authentic than even numbers – with the number seven being particularly effective.
		</p>
		<div class="list_title">2. They stay focused</div>
		<p>
			Your readers are likely reading your content for one main purpose – to learn about something related to a need, want or interest. Listicles are a great way to organize and present actionable information, statistics and hard facts while staying focused on one topic.
		</p>
		<div class="list_title">3. They’re perfect for busy audiences</div>
		<p>
			People are busier than ever, and they’re more likely to skim through a list than dive into a long article. A well-written list will help readers learn and retain key information points without having to commit a lot of time.
		</p>
		<div class="list_title">4. They’re shareable</div>
		<p>
			Listicles are one of the most-shared forms of content online, and it’s not hard to see why. They tend to get more clicks in the first place and, if they provide good information, people will want to share it with their networks. With a bit of strategy, you can use listicles to boost your social-media visibility in a big way.
		</p>
		<div class="list_title">5. They inspire comments and conversation</div>
		<p>
			Have you ever noticed the many comments and questions generated by Buzzfeed articles? Listicles are great at provoking conversation amongst readers, whether it’s to let you know there’s something you left off your list or if they disagree with one of the points you did include. Either way, they’re a great way to interact with your audience and build engagement.
		</p>
		<div class="list_title">6. They’re what readers want</div>
		<p>
			Today’s audiences are increasingly looking for great content that answers their questions and curiosities quickly and concisely. And if you can include more images and less text, even better. This will make readers much more likely to come back to you again when they’re looking for answers and/or solutions.
		</p>
		<div class="list_title">It’s still about creating value</div>
		<p>
			Even though listicles have been called the “new face of content marketing,” they aren’t necessarily a slam dunk. Many fail because they are too clickbait-y with content smothered in ads or not living up to the hyped-up headline. And while listicles do get a lot of attention – they only provide your audience with a brief overview rather than any depth information. There are also just a lot of them out there to compete with.
		</p>
		<p>
			With everything in content marketing, creating good and valuable content for your audience is paramount. A listicle is just another way to organize the information and make it more accessible for certain audiences. But the quality of the content and the engagement you get from it are entirely up to you.
